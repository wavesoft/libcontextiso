 Tiny Contextualization CD-ROM Creation Library
-------------------------------------------------

 1. INTRODUCTION
===================

This library provides the bare minimum code that is required to create a valid ISO-9660 (CDFS) disk image.
The disk will contain only one file, called 'CONTEXT.SH' and it's contents can be specified using the build_simple_cdrom() function.

 2. KNOWN LIMITATIONS
========================

I remind again that this is just a tiny library to create contextualization CD-ROM images. 
It is designed to have small footprint and being able to create ISOs with configuration information that will not exceed 2KiB. Therefore there are many limitations. For example:

 * This library can create CD-ROMs with *only* 1 file
 * The maximum supported file size 2048 characters
 * The maximum supported filename length is 12 characters (DOS 8+3)

 3. USAGE
===========

To build the static library 'libcontextiso.a' simply type : make
To use this library, include the header 'include/contextiso.h' and link your code against 'libcontextiso.a'. The exported functions are:

 char * build_simple_cdrom( "volume_name", "file.name", "contents", contents_size );
 char * build_context_cdrom( "contents of CONTEXT.SH" );

Both functions return a string buffer with the contents of the CD-ROM image. The length of the returned buffer is CONTEXTISO_CDROM_SIZE bytes.

For an example see 'example.c'. To build type : make example
