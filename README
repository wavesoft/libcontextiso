 Tiny Contextualization CD-ROM Creation Library
-------------------------------------------------

 1. INTRODUCTION

This library provides the bare minimum code that is required to create
a valid ISO-9660 (CDFS) disk image.

The disk will contain only one file, called 'CONTEXT.SH' and it's contents
can be specified using the context_cd_create() function.

 2. KNOWN LIMITATIONS

I remind again that this is just a tiny library to create contextualization CD-ROM images. 
It is designed to have small footprint and being able to create ISOs with configuration information 
that will not exceed 2KiB. Therefore there are many limitations. For example, this library:

 * Can create CD-ROMs with *only* 1 file
 * The maximum file size 2048 characters
 * The maximum filename length is 12 characters (DOS 8+3)

 3. USAGE

To build the static library 'libcontextiso.a' simply type : make
You can find the exposed functions in include/contextiso.h
